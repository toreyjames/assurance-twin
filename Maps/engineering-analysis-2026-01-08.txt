## Engineering Assessment (Automated)

*Note: This is an automated assessment based on template comparisons. For detailed engineering analysis, ensure the analysis API is configured.*

### 1. BASELINE COMPLETENESS

**Facility Profile:**
- 7,267 assets documented across 3 site(s)
- 12 process units identified
- Match rate with discovery: 99%

**Assessment:** ✅ Good coverage - 99% of engineering baseline validated by discovery.

### 2. INSTRUMENTATION OVERVIEW

| Process Unit | Total Assets | Critical (Tier 1) | Networkable (Tier 2) |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Crude Distillation Unit | 656 | 207 | 50 |
| Fluid Catalytic Cracker | 799 | 231 | 79 |
| Hydrocracker | 749 | 209 | 56 |
| Reformer | 524 | 158 | 35 |
| Coker Unit | 780 | 207 | 52 |
| Hydrotreater | 497 | 125 | 33 |
| Tank Farm | 438 | 142 | 28 |
| Loading Rack | 407 | 122 | 30 |
| Utilities | 518 | 156 | 33 |
| Control Room | 691 | 220 | 49 |

### 3. DATA QUALITY FLAGS

⚠️ **6 critical assets** documented but not discovered on network. These may be:
- Offline or disconnected
- On isolated network segments not scanned
- Incorrectly documented

🚨 **10 critical devices** discovered but not in engineering baseline. These may be:
- Recently added systems not yet documented
- Undocumented test or development systems
- Potential unauthorized devices requiring investigation

### 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Validate blind spots** - Investigate the 100 assets in engineering baseline that weren't discovered. Determine if they're offline, on separate networks, or documentation errors.

2. **Document orphans** - Review the 100 discovered devices not in baseline. Add legitimate devices to engineering documentation.

3. **Expand discovery scope** - If match rate is below 80%, consider running discovery tools on additional network segments.

4. **Review process unit coverage** - Ensure all 8 typical Oil & Gas Refinery process units are represented.
